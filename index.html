        JADAVPUR UNIVERSITY MODEL UNITED NATIONS
      </h3>

      <p>
      Jadavpur University's global renown comes for what it collectively wishes to achieve as an academic institution and a space for critical thinking. The JU Model United Nations is the manifestation of that desire. It is a platform by the University for students across the world to construct a vision for a better tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
Since its inception in 2015, Jadavpur University Model United Nations (JUMUN) has evolved into a prominent platform for diplomatic discourse and international awareness. Inaugurated by Mr. Yuri Kolobanov, Consulate General of the Russian Federation to India, the inaugural edition marked the beginning of a legacy renowned in the East India circuit. Subsequent editions, such as the impactful 2017 gathering of 5000 participants, delved into crucial issues like Sustainable Development and healthcare policies. JUMUN's commitment extended in 2018 with initiatives addressing social concerns, advocating education for underprivileged children, and promoting women's healthcare. The initiative continued to flourish, introducing the JUMUN Junior's Initiative in 2019 and successfully transitioning to an online format in 2021 amidst global health dynamics. With diverse forums and a global presence, JUMUN consistently fosters informed discussions on matters ranging from geopolitical crises to environmental agreements.
      </p>

      <p>
      With a legacy this strong, we as a team only aim to expand our ambit further by extending the conversation to people in this country and abroad. We understand our role and responsibility in addressing the real issues that lie outside committee rooms and we only aim to extend this in our 12th edition by aspiring to diversify our dialogue and endeavour.

    The Special Political and Decolonisation Committee is one of the six main committees of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and is also known as the Fourth Committee. It is responsible for a broad range of issues, including decolonisation, international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, the effects of atomic radiation, assistance to Palestinian refugees, questions relating to information, peacekeeping operations, and special political missions. Although its resolutions are recommendatory in nature, they form the basis for international consensus and future treaties. As an inclusive forum comprising all 193 UN Member States, the Committee ensures that every country’s voice is given a platform. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at the UNGA-SPECPOL in JUMUN 2026, we seek nuanced solutions to complex problems that maintain geopolitical objectives while remaining steadfast to the greater goal of bettering the world for all of humanity.

    The Economic and Social Council is one of the 6 principal organs of the UN, which controls and coordinates the economic and social functions of the UN in achieving its developmental objectives, specifically through its specialised agencies. These developmental objectives include ensuring a higher standard of living, education, and healthcare, and fostering respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, among others. 
   </p>
    <p>
      As social and economic indicators continue to show wide disparities in income, infrastructure, and quality of life, the ECOSOC in JUMUN 2026 seeks versatile, actionable solutions to the problems that plague the modern world, particularly the developing world.

The Commission on the Status of Women is the main global intergovernmental body exclusively dedicated to the promotion of gender equality, the rights, and the empowerment of women. It is a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council and is instrumental in promoting women’s and girls’ rights and documenting the reality of their lives while shaping global standards on gender equality. In addition to being historically underrepresented, undervalued, and discriminated against, women’s leadership and political engagement are frequently jeopardised on all levels, from local to intergovernmental, and this is exactly what CSW seeks to rectify. 
</p>
<p>
      Here at the CSW in JUMUN 2026, we seek discourse that truly engages with the deeply entrenched roots of systemic misogyny and acknowledges the full extent of patriarchal oppression, for it is only then that concrete steps in combating the same can be implemented.

The International Seabed Authority is an autonomous international organisation established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is the organisation through which State parties to UNCLOS organise and control all mineral resources-related activities in the area for the benefit of humankind as a whole. ISA thus has the mandate to protect the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep-seabed related activities. The ISA is founded on the principle that the international seabed and its mineral resources constitute the “common heritage of mankind,” so no state may claim sovereignty over them, and the benefits must be shared equitably among all. 
    </p>
    <p>
    At the ISA in JUMUN 2026, we seek delegates who preserve their portfolios' strategic goals but remain committed to actualising the ISA’s original objective of ensuring the greater good of all nations through the mineral-based and other resources of the seabed.</p>

While opposing political factions exist within the Indian democracy, it is collaboration and coordination that must ever be prioritised for the benefit of the nation. The All India Political Parties Meet is a committee in JUMUN 2026 aimed precisely at achieving this objective. Representatives of political parties all over the country, whether national or regional, ruling or opposition, are given an equal voice in discussing legislation, public policy, and ensuring government accountability in a manner more flexible than the formal legislative bodies. This committee would be a test of how effectively delegates can engage with national issues constructively while also preserving their respective parties’ political and strategic interests.
</p>
<p>
 At the AIPPM at JUMUN 2026, we seek delegates who balance astute political acumen with moral integrity towards serving the people, channelling a better version of their respective portfolios than their real-life counterparts.

Leading news organisations and media hubs are represented by the International Press. It meticulously examines the committee discussions and puts together the conference newsletter. Any Model United Nations should always include a segment on the international press (MUN). Participants in IP will act as journalists and photographers for various news organisations. Journalists will have the opportunity to participate in other committees as a third party to report on their development, effectiveness, debate flow, alliance-building, and other aspects. All of the conference's moments are documented by photographers. In addition to being stunning, photographs that tell a story demand that their subjects be positioned in a way that does so even in the absence of captions.
    </p>
    <p>
 At the IP in JUMUN 2026, we seek journalists and photographers who don’t just report but lend a critical fly-on-the-wall perspective on the actors and processes that shape policy.

South-South cooperation (SSC) refers to the technical cooperation among developing countries in the Global South. It is a tool used by the states, international organisations, academics, civil society, and the private sector to collaborate and share knowledge, skills, and successful initiatives in specific areas such as agricultural development, human rights, urbanisation, health, climate change, etc. The High-Level Committee on South-South Cooperation is the main policymaking body on SSC. It is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly that was originally comprised of representatives of all countries participating in the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Committee monitors the implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, ensures sustained efforts to strengthen Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries (TCDC), promotes new policies and innovative approaches, reviews the effective use of financial resources without affecting existing programmes, and ensures coordination of all promotional and operational TCDC activities across the United Nations development system. 
    </p>
    <p>
The HLC - SSC in JUMUN 2026 seeks to exemplify and actualise collaborative progress among economically weaker nations so as to collectively insulate each other from their vulnerabilities and emerge more prosperous and developed as a whole.

    <p>
Despite long efforts to suppress and combat the same, criminal activity at the regional as well as the national or international level, including but not limited to manufacture, traffic, and consumption of illicit drugs, continues to show a troubling persistence in several parts of the world. Moreover, these problems have historically had a troubling tendency to be attributed to simplistic factors and have been dealt with by similar brute-force tactics. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime was set up in 1997 to combat these issues. 
</p><p>
The UNODC in JUMUN 2026 requires a nuanced understanding of the complex social, political, economic, and cultural realities that manifest in these problems and proposes solutions that account for their complex, layered root causes and afford protection for victims and at-risk individuals on all sides of the table.
